## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you encounter a problem with one of our products, [search if an issue already exists]. 
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using the corresponding [issue form].

### Contribute to existing issues

The best feedback is actionable feedback.
The more details we have about a product enhancement, feature request, or bug report, the faster we can ship updates to address the feedback.
This is where you come in! 
If you want to help improve our products beyond your own feedback, scan through our [existing issues] to find one that interests you. 
Note that you can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters (see [Labels] for more information). 

* **Is the feedback relevant to your use of the product?**  

  If so, comment on the issue to document your support! 
  Even a simple comment like `+1` helps us prioritize what to work on next. 

* **Does the feedback need clarification or additional context?** 

  Sometimes we get feedback that we don't understand, or that we can't reproduce.
  When that happens we may ask for clarification or additinal context. 
  When these questions go unanswered, the feedback can get stuck in a holding pattern.
  If you see feedback with unanswered questions that is relevant to your interests, don't hesitate to jump in to the conversation! 
  You just might help provide the missing context that is needed to improve the product!
